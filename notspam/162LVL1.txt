    <div class="post-content"><p>I wanted to write this to share with you all my birth story and also to keep the memory alive for myself. The event of our second son&#8217;s birth is something I wish I could relive again and again because of how beautiful and amazing it was. The birth of my first son was something I will never forget, but there was also some disappointment in that I couldn&#8217;t see his face as they delivered him via C-section, then couldn&#8217;t hold him for another two hours after my surgery. It wasn&#8217;t long after recovering from his birth that I was already thinking about attempting a VBAC for my next one. So after learning I was pregnant 9 months ago, my husband and I weighed the risks and moved forward with a VBAC delivery. I&#8217;m so glad I did. Here&#8217;s how my birth story started.</p>
<p>With both of my pregnancies, it&#8217;s normal for me to have several hours of close together contractions before the real onset of labor starts. So was the case on the night of June 5th. I started contracting 4 minutes apart and about a minute long. Growing tired of timing them, I finally fell asleep only to awaken in the morning by them still occurring. At this point I had a gut feeling that this was it. So I went about my day seeing if they would grow stronger or more regular. They were inconsistent, but still about 3-8 minutes apart. By evening they grew noticeably stronger and closer together. I made arrangements for the care of our older son and my husband and I prepared to make the trip to the hospital. We arrived around 7pm, they checked me and I was dialated to 1 cm. The nurse told me I could walk around and see if I progressed any more. So we walked the halls of the hospital for an hour, they checked me again and I was the same. So they sent us home. We went to bed and the contractions grew stronger. After about 40 minutes, I felt the familiar feeling of my water breaking and exclaimed &#8220;Oh my gosh! My water broke!&#8221; My husband bolted out of bed very excited and we made the trek back to the hospital. By now it was about midnight.</p>
<p>Labor grew more painful as the night wore on, but still bearable. My goal was to have a natural birth without anything for pain, but I still had an open mind.</p>
<p><strong>4:00am</strong> My parents came around 4 am and my mom coached me through the contractions&#8230;it was so nice having her there! The night is sort of a blur, but eventually I was checked around this same time to find my cervix dialated to 3 cm, but the baby was at a -3 station, which means he hadn&#8217;t dropped yet and was at the highest point he could be in my uterus.</p>
<p><strong>7:30am</strong> Three and half hours later they checked me again and I was still at a 3 (ugh!) but he had dropped some to a -2 station. Which meant I was finally able to walk around to help labor progress. The rest of the day wore on, the contractions were about 5 minutes apart as long as I was standing, and still not too painful.</p>
<p><strong>11am</strong> Before noon I was checked with still no progress. At this point we began discussing our options. I could continue this course to see if I would progress on my own, induce more intense labor with pitocin, or have a repeat c-section. I was already aware of the risks of having a VBAC, and I knew the chances of uterine rupture would double with pitocin. I really didn&#8217;t want to go this route. With every contraction I had, at the forefront of my mind was the thought that my uterus could tear open at any moment (morbid, I know). I gave in to fear and told my husband that I wanted another c-section. Thank God a dear friend was there to remind me of the verse &#8220;God has not given me a spirit of fear, but of power, love and a sound mind.&#8221; Such a simple truth, but so glad she reminded me of it. It wasn&#8217;t long after that that I prayed and felt peace about going with a low pitocin drip.</p>
<p><strong>12pm</strong> At around noon, they hooked me up and it wasn&#8217;t long before I experienced awful, painful contractions, the worst pain I&#8217;ve ever felt IN MY LIFE. Standing up helped me cope, and my husband and mother coached me through each one. After over 3 hours of increasing pain and contractions 1-2 minutes apart, I chose to have an epidural because I felt so tired at this point and there was no way after so many hours of labor my body would have endured on it&#8217;s own.</p>
<p><strong>3:18pm</strong> I got an epidural, which in and of itself was one of the worst points of the day. Trying to hold still during the worst pain you&#8217;ve ever felt while you get a needle in your back was not easy. If I do an epidural with my next one, I&#8217;ll be sure to get it much earlier! Once it kicked in though&#8230;ah. I couldn&#8217;t feel a darn thing. It was awesome!</p>
<p><strong>5:00pm</strong> After a couple hours of labor with epidural and increasing the pitocin drip, my contractions were very close together and super strong. And they were doing something! At this point, I was 8 cm dialated and he was at a +1 station. I could tell it was going to go fast now!</p>
<p><strong>7:00pm</strong> I began asking if my doctor was going to get here soon, because I could feel the weight of the baby bearing down on my backside. With every contraction, I could feel him moving down, it was incredible. But still no pain.</p>
<p><strong>7:30pm</strong> Very strong contractions and I felt like he was ready to just come sliding out all on his own! I told my mom that I thought I could push and my mom ran to get nurses and check me. I was dialated 10 cm and he was pretty much ready to come out. They told me with the next two contractions that I would &#8220;labor down&#8221; and not to push just yet. The doctor came in casually, then realized very quickly that she had come just in time. I was given a quick tutorial about pushing and with the next contraction, I pushed with all my might. After about 6 pushes and just a couple minutes, my little man was born. My doctor and I couldn&#8217;t believe how easy it was! Kent cut the cord and they put him on my tummy. I was elated. I thought I would cry buckets, but I was surprised that I just felt overwhelming joy as I looked at him for the first time. The tears came a couple minutes later.</p>

<p>Recovery was great. Hours after he was born I had a dramatic dip in my blood pressure from some post-partum hemorrhaging and I also had a fever from an infection. Yuck. That was not fun. But those issues were cleared up by the next morning.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1567" title="P1000268" src="http://evie-s.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/P1000268.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="295" /></p>
<p>For any of you reading this considering a VBAC, I would highly encourage you to try it. It&#8217;s not for everyone obviously, but if you find a great doctor that thinks you are a good candidate, you should go for it. I&#8217;m so thrilled that I was able to experience childbirth this way, and really learned a good lesson about not letting fear control my decisions.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and letting me share! After a wonderful break, I hope to get back to regular posting by next week!</p>

    <div class="post-content"><p>Hello all! Just a quick post to let you know that our little Abe Alexander entered the world on June 6th. He&#8217;s such a great baby, very cuddly, a great sleeper and eater, with a head of dark hair and as cute as can be.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1558" title="welcomebaby" src="http://evie-s.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/welcomebaby.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="528" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to write another post with the full birth story soon, but I&#8217;m pleased to report that my VBAC was successful and experiencing the miracle of birth was nothing short of amazing. Thank you to everyone who supported, prayed for, and encouraged me!</p>
<p>We are all doing fine and recovering nicely (despite a case of jaundice after coming home from the hospital) and adjusting to life with a fourth member of the family. Love to you all!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ginger is awesome for carsickness or any kind of nausea. If it&#039;s for your little one, you&#039;d have to open the capsules &amp; pour out the ginger into something &amp; mix it up...not sure if the taste would be too much (ginger can be pretty &#039;hot&#039;). Maybe ginger snap cookies (make your own to be sure you have enough in them to actually prevent or soothe the nausea. Premade cookies can have artificial flavoring, which would do no good). Hope this helps!]]></description>

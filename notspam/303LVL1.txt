				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_342085" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-342085" src="https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/ts_05_large.jpg?w=600&#038;h=405" alt="NYC Soloist Taylor Stanley " width="600" height="405" title="Mesmerizing: Watch This NYC Ballet Dancer Move For a Fashion Shoot" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo: <a href="http://www.farfetch.com/editorial/the-new-york-city-ballets-taylor-stanley.aspx" target="_blank" target="_blank">Farfetch/Anthony Maule</a></em></p></div>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been privy to a fashion photo shoot in action, you&#8217;ll know that seeing a talented model turning it on for the camera can be fascinating to watch. It&#8217;s something in the way they move fluidly, intuitively knowing which angles will flatter the clothes&#8211;and themselves&#8211;the most. But, of all the shoots we&#8217;ve sat in on, none have looked quite like the partnership between online retailer Farfetch and the New York City Ballet.</p>
<h2><strong>MORE: <a href="http://stylecaster.com/burlesque-twerk-beethoven/"title="Best Video Ever: Watch This Burlesque Dancer Twerk to Beethoven"  target="_blank">Watch This Burlesque Dancer Twerk to Beethoven</a></strong></h2>
<p>Farfetch snagged NYC Ballet soloist, <strong>Taylor Stanley</strong>, to feature in an all-white menswear campaign. Modeling sleek all-white garb by Balmain, Our Legacy, Alexander McQueen, DSquared2, and more names from Farfetch&#8217;s designer offering, Stanley performed for the camera in a way that most models never could.</p>
<p>The incredible dancer&#8211;who told us he rehearses from 10:30 a.m. until 8:00 p.m, and then performs on stage nearly every single day&#8211;is mesmerizing to watch.</p>
<p>Take a look at this exclusive behind-the-scenes video we recorded at the shoot, and then <a href="http://www.farfetch.com/editorial/the-new-york-city-ballets-taylor-stanley.aspx" target="_blank" target="_blank">check out the full feature</a> over at Farfetch.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_341986" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-341986" src="https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/wenn214569881.jpg?w=600&#038;h=941" alt="Trooping of the Colour Celebration at Buckingham Palace" width="600" height="941" title="Flu Season Etiquette: A Field Guide to Being Sick at Work" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Wenn.</p></div>
<p>The flu is everywhere this winter. It&#8217;s at the grocery store where the checkout person is sneezing, on the public bus where you&#8217;re sitting next to someone who can&#8217;t stop hacking, and the most problematic, at work, where the co-worker you practically share a desk with has been wheezing for weeks.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://officeteam.rhi.mediaroom.com/2014-01-28-survey-seven-in-10-workers-frequently-come-to-the-office-when-feeling-sick" target="_blank">2014 OfficeTeam survey,</a> seven in 10 workers say they come to work when they&#8217;re feeling sick, not wanting to take time off. This is a particularly frightening statistic considering the Center of Disease Control says people with the flu can spread the virus to people up to six feet away, mostly from droplets made when they sneeze, cough, or even just talk. People can also get the flu by touching objects or surfaces that have the virus on it.</p>
<h2>MORE: <a href="http://stylecaster.com/13-ways-to-make-your-desk-a-healthier-space-in-2015/">How To Make Your Workplace Healthier </a></h2>
<p>Indeed, the workplace is a minefield for illness, and soldiering on when you&#8217;re under the weather isn&#8217;t only bad for your own health, but also the health of everyone around you.</p>
<p>Here, some etiquette rules to live by when you come down with something, with expert tips from <strong>Anna Post</strong>, the great-great-granddaughter of Emily Post, and a co-author of <em>Emily Post&#8217;s Etiquette, 18th edition</em>. &#8220;Good flu etiquette is really about having consideration for other people and not getting them sick,&#8221; Post told us. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>1. Know the difference between the flu and the cold. </strong></p>
<p>The flu and a cold come with similar symptoms, but it is crucial to know the difference between the two because the flu is <em>highly</em> contagious. Experts advise remembering the &#8216;F.A.C.T.S.&#8217; acronym to decide if you have the flu—F stands for fever, A is for aches, C is for chills, T is for tiredness and S stands for sudden onset (unlike a cold, the flu strikes fast). If you do find that you have the flu, keep in mind that the virus is contagious for a solid five to seven days, that it can spread via airborne droplets, and can infect someone who is up to six feet away from it. Yikes is right.</p>
<p><strong>2. If you&#8217;re contagious, just stay home. </strong></p>
<p>So you officially have the flu and you&#8217;re contagious. &#8220;I think the biggest flu etiquette offense is knowing you have flu symptoms and still going out instead of making an appointment with your doctor,&#8221; Post says. &#8220;If you know you&#8217;re not feeling well, you need to stay at home. That goes for work and travel and parties.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>3. Clean and disinfect the surfaces that you touch. </strong></p>
<p>Those who have the flu should consider it their responsibility to clean and disinfect that they touch including sink faucets and door handles. Disinfecting wipes are your new best friend—just while you&#8217;re sick, of course.</p>
<p><strong>4. Be aware when you sneeze and cough. </strong></p>
<p>Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you sneeze and then throw the tissue away, immediately. Public health officials even suggest using anti-viral tissues since cold and flu viruses can live up to 24 hours on regular tissues. Find yourself without a tissue and need to sneeze or cough? Do it into your elbow, to prevent the virus from spreading.</p>
<p><strong>5. Wash your hands and often</strong>.</p>
<p>If you come down with something, become slightly compulsive about washing your hands (and for at least 20 seconds with both soap and warm water). This is particularly important before eating, after using the restroom, and after being outside. Hand sanitizer can also come in handy if you find yourself unable to wash your hands, so make sure that if you are sick you are carrying some around with you.</p>
<p><strong>6. Just stop sharing things.</strong></p>
<p>Just stop sharing things when you&#8217;re sick—particularly utensils, dishes, and linens. During flu season, simply switch over to disposable products where and when you can.</p>
<p><strong>7. Stop being so polite.</strong></p>
<p>Not sure what to do when normal social etiquette requires that you go in for a hug or a handshake and you&#8217;re sick? &#8220;Just tell them &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry, I feel like I&#8217;m coming down with something but it&#8217;s nice to meet you,'&#8221; says Post. &#8220;And if they&#8217;re sick, I would keep it simple and tell them, &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t shake hands but it&#8217;s nice to meet you.&#8217; Or shake hands and then immediately wash up.&#8221; Better safe than sorry.</p>

Time to DIY.</p></div>
<p>You might have noticed that book bags—quite literally bags that are made to look like books—are having a fashion moment, often popping up on red carpets, on your favorite high-end shopping sites, and in the hands of street style stars.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan, you also might have noticed that the really good ones—we&#8217;re talking <strong>Charlotte Olympia</strong>, <strong>Kate Spade</strong>, and <strong>Olympia Le-Tan</strong>—aren&#8217;t cheap. Quite the opposite: <a href="http://www.net-a-porter.com/product/516588/Olympia_Le_Tan/disney-peter-pan-embroidered-clutch" target="_blank" target="_blank">Le-Tan&#8217;s embroidered styles go for nearly $2,000. </a></p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s a girl to do when faced with the desire for a piece of fashion, but not the budget? DIY that sh*t.</p>
<p>While browsing one of our favorite blogs, A Beautiful Mess, <a href="http://www.abeautifulmess.com/2015/01/turn-an-old-book-into-a-new-purse.html" target="_blank" target="_blank">we found a do-it-yourself tutorial </a>that illustrates how to turn an old book (we suggest trolling thrift stores for vintage finds) into a rad clutch—and there&#8217;s no sewing required.</p>

<p>When it come to anti-animal cruelty, anti-fur and vegetarianism, celebrities are leading the charge. Apart from publicly declaring they won&#8217;t wear fur or pledging allegiance to a plant-based diet, lots of famous folks also prove their point by getting naked in PETA&#8217;s iconic ads.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unless you&#8217;ve been hibernating under a rock this winter (wouldn&#8217;t blame you), you probably aware that <a href="http://stylecaster.com/what-nyfw-is-like-for-a-street-style-photographer-getty-images-timur-emek-tells-all/"title="What NYFW is Like For a Street Style Photographer: Getty Images’ Timur Emek Tells All" >New York Fashion Week</a> is kicking off tomorrow. That means out-of-town <a href="http://stylecaster.com/17-fashion-bloggers-who-also-have-awesome-online-stores/"title="17 Fashion Bloggers Who Also Have Awesome Online Stores" >fashion bloggers</a> are rolling into the city&#8217;s airports today, toting bags filled with who-knows-what wardrobe wonders.</p>
<p>So, ahead of fashion&#8217;s biggest week, we asked four of our favorite jet-set style bloggers to go ahead and show us what they&#8217;re packing for the New York circuit. We gathered four flat lay shots from across the globe to get a better idea of what you can expect the style crowd to step out in this season. Take a look.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Most memorable fashion week moment:</strong> The first time I shot street style at NYFW was 2012: When I spotted the likes of street style stars <a href="http://stylecaster.com/street-style-milan-miroslava-duma/"title="20 Street Style Snaps from Milan: Miroslava Duma, Anna Dello Russo, More"  target="_blank"><strong>Miroslava Duma</strong></a> and <strong>Anna Dello Russo</strong>, my jaw just dropped, and it took me a good second or two before I snapped out of it and start snapping <em>photos</em>. Even though we&#8217;ve all seen hundreds of photos of them, it was still amazing to see with my own eyes just how stylish and daring these women are.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Despite long-held theories. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=stylecaster.com&#038;blog=35011528&#038;post=341956&#038;subd=scstylecaster&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-341981" src="https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/kf2xvk7nodxiuhfvigyx.jpg?w=636&#038;h=358" alt="carrie and big" width="636" height="358" title="Turns Out, Men Arent Hardwired to Sleep Around After All" /></p>
<p>For years, men have been given a pass for being players, using evolution as a viable explanation for their behavior. The long-held theory assumes the more women a man has sex with, the more likely he is to pass on his genes—the measure of evolutionary success.</p>
<h2>MORE: <a href="http://stylecaster.com/call-it-the-clooney-effect-how-george-is-affecting-the-way-men-date/">How George Clooney is Affecting the Way Men Date</a></h2>
<p>Not so fast, guys. In a<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/14/us-science-mating-idUSKBN0KN00R20150114" target="_blank"> new study conducted at the University of Utah</a>, anthropologists presented evidence that male promiscuity is <em>not</em> actually something that&#8217;s hardwired, and found that whether men prefer commitment or flings actually depends a lot on their circumstances, particularly gender ratios.</p>
<p>Bottom line here: When men don&#8217;t find themselves surrounded by a lot of women, they actually prefer long-term relationships. Women, meanwhile, when surrounded by a lot of men, and with a lot of dating choices, can be similarly interested in one-night stands, going against the common stereotype that women like to settle down.</p>
<h2>MORE: <a href="http://stylecaster.com/study-says-you-should-be-less-picky-about-finding-a-partner/">Holding Out For Mr.Right? Don&#8217;t Bother</a></h2>
<p><strong>Ryan Schacht</strong> and <strong>Monique Borgerhoff Mulder</strong> of the University of California Davis conducted a similar study examining eight communities in Makushi, Amerindians of Guyana. They found that the more men outnumbered women, the less likely they were to prefer flings over commitment.</p>
<p>According to Schacht that makes perfect evolutionary sense too, because, according to him, commitment actually increases the number of &#8220;mating opportunities&#8221; men have compared to when they have to constantly seek out new partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best strategy is to find one woman and stick with her,&#8221; he told <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/14/us-science-mating-idUSKBN0KN00R20150114" target="_blank">Reuters</a>.</p><br />  <a href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/scstylecaster.wordpress.com/341956/"rel="nofollow"  target="_blank"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/scstylecaster.wordpress.com/341956/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=stylecaster.com&#038;blog=35011528&#038;post=341956&#038;subd=scstylecaster&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here&#8217;s some surprising news:<strong> Kanye West</strong> and<strong> Taylor Swift</strong> have clearly moved passed West&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://stylecaster.com/kanye-west-apologizes-taylor-swift-interrupting-her-speech/"title="Kanye West Apologizes to Taylor Swift for Interrupting Her Speech"  target="_blank">Imma let you finish</a>&#8221; blunder, and are set to collaborate on a song together.</p>
<p>Nope, this isn&#8217;t an early April Fools joke: Kanye made the announcement early this morning in a radio interview with <strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong>, suggesting the pair patched things up at the <a href="http://stylecaster.com/grammys-red-carpet-2015-all-the-amazing-and-outrageous-outfits/"title="Grammys Red Carpet 2015: All the Amazing—and Outrageous—Outfits"  target="_blank">Grammys</a> on the weekend, and now plan to work together on a musical collaboration.</p>
<p>“[Taylor] wants to go in the studio,” Kanye <a href="http://t.co/gWfy6uhpia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">told Ryan</a> this morning. He continued to explain that he is always looking to work with any artist who has a massive fan base, Swift included.</p>
<p>“You heard it here first: <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest" target="_blank" target="_blank">@kanyewest</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13" target="_blank" target="_blank">@taylorswift13</a> are going into the studio together!” tweeted Ryan Seacrest’s <a href="https://twitter.com/OnAirWithRyan/status/565528243814813697" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">radio show</a> after his interview with Kanye.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The announcement comes shortly after Kanye <a href="http://stylecaster.com/rihanna-kanye-and-paul-mccartneys-fourfiveseconds-video-is-here/"title="Rihanna, Kanye, and Paul McCartney’s ‘FourFiveSeconds’ Video is Here!"  target="_blank">released a song</a> &#8220;FourFiveSeconds&#8221; with <strong>Rihanna</strong> and <strong>Paul McCartney. </strong></p>

<p><a href="http://stylecaster.com/the-daily-edited-monogrammed-leather-accessories/"title="Minimalists Will Love This New Leather Accessories Brand"  target="_blank">Like many women</a>, I&#8217;m a sucker for <a href="http://stylecaster.com/the-daily-edited-monogrammed-leather-accessories/"title="Minimalists Will Love This New Leather Accessories Brand"  target="_blank">small leather goods</a>—mini card cases, pouches, and passport holders, even minuscule address books (those are actual <em>books</em> where people would write down where other people live—what a concept.) One thing I don&#8217;t have? A mini leather cord organizer shaped like a taco embossed with sayings like &#8220;Swipe Right,&#8221; &#8220;Eat Me,&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;d Tag That.&#8221;</p>

<p>They&#8217;re called Sweetheart Tacos, and they&#8217;re the perfect way to contain earbuds, USB cords, phone chargers, and other sundry wires we schlep around (and dedicate precious moments of our lives untangling.)</p>
<p>Plus—because they&#8217;re adorable without being sappy—they&#8217;re also the best Valentine&#8217;s Day gift ever if you&#8217;re in the market for something cute for your BFF. Or BFFs, since you can snag all five for $40.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning to keep one for myself—my small leather goods collection could use a modern update (sorry, address books.)</p>

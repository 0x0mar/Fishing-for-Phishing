				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you building a website for your business? If so, there is a very important task you should do first. This is choosing a suitable web host for your needs. Selecting a web host may look like an easy task while it is, in fact, daunting. With so many companies promising to offer you unlimited resources, 99 percent uptime and solid technical support; you could easily make the wrong decision. To assist you make the right choice, here are six factors you want to consider.<span id="more-1213"></span></p>
<h2>Cost of the hosting service</h2>
<p>Price is the first thing that many novice webmasters would like to consider and it is okay. However, price is not the only factor you have to think about when selecting an appropriate web host. It could actually be the least important factor if your goal is to pick the right web host for a website that will sell products or services. If you intend to make money through your site, avoid cheap or free web hosting services. The reason why you have to pay nothing or very little money for their hosting service is because there is no technical support. Extended downtime will be inevitable and this will translate to business losses. It is wiser to choose an expensive dedicated hosting service as it will be managed on your behalf.</p>
<h2>Technical support</h2>
<p>When your <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/13/what-to-do-when-your-website-goes-down/">website goes down</a> you need immediate technical support to restore it. Prior to choosing a given service provider make sure that they have a twenty-four hour customer support service provided via email, instant chat feature, toll-free phone line or ticketing system. You have to know whether the company’s staffs are competent enough to know what’s wrong with your site and how it can be fixed and re-hosted. As you do your research you will find out that companies are not equal when it comes to the quality of their customer service. It is good to use a company that mostly provides support via a ticketing service, as it can solve your issue speedily.</p>
<h2>Features provided</h2>
<p>If you are serious about making money via your site, do not pick a host that just provides servers. There has to be one unique feature that separates a host from its competition. This add-on feature is what you want to focus on. It could be anything including regular data backups, many data centre, and free domain privacy among others. If you find one company that provides an add-on that you consider important, that can be a sign that you need to work with it. Perhaps you want to host an e-commerce website. If so you need a web host that can provide a shopping cart and an <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/ssl-information-center/what-is-an-ssl-certificate.html">SSL certificate</a>. Find out if a given web host offers support for auto responders, SMTP, email forwarders and IMAP among others. Website tools like galleries, blogs, forums and CMS are often provided for free.</p>
<h2>Track record: read customer reviews</h2>
<p>The customer testimonials provided on most websites do not necessarily represent the opinions of real and live people. Hence you need to be a little bit creative to get information from people who have bought hosting services from a given company. You can look the company up on social media or do a Google search for their blog. In addition, you could check whether there are complaints about them on the Better Business Bureau website.</p>
<h2>Room for growth</h2>
<p>Although you are building your website now it does not mean that you will be where you are now in the next five years. Therefore as you pick a hosting service you need to figure out whether they fit into your future plans. In short, what you think is adequate hosting now might not meet your requirements in the next few years. If a given host has dedicated server solutions or a VPS solution, that is a good sign that they will accommodate your growth in future.</p>
<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>Without a control panel or user interface you cannot edit your website without seeking help from the host’s technical support team. Even if the interface is there it should be customer-friendly and easy to figure out.</p>
<h2>Conclusion &amp; final suggestion</h2>
<p>The above-mentioned tips should assist you when deciding on the best hosting company to work with. We also highly recommend checking sites like <a href="http://www.top10bestwebsitehosting.com">top10bestwebsitehosting.com</a> can give you all the necessary date needed when coming to choose your hosting. By so doing you can avoid loss of revenue, malware attacks and poor search engine rankings in future.

<p>To start the newbie out, a website builder is a tool that allows you to create a website without manual coding. This enables you to override all the technical knowledge needed to produce a website from scratch.</p>
<p>So, you wonder if your Do It Yourself website will take off into the light of the day without you having any technical knowledge to build it, and the answer is yes. Why? There are many misconceptions about free <a href="http://www.anblik.com/website-builder" title="Top 20 best list of website builder reviews to create website" class="pretty-link-keyword" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website builders</a>, but they are disproved right here.</p>

<h6>1. You need to have programming knowledge to use a free website builder</h6>
<p>Now that is a load of hogwash. You need exactly zero programming skills to use a website builder. All you need is creativity and a good understanding of what you want to use the website for. Then you choose a good online website builder, and you are good to go. Good <a href="http://www.anblik.com/website-builder" title="Top 20 best list of website builder reviews to create website" class="pretty-link-keyword" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website builders</a> have wizards or templates which help you build your website from scratch without using a single code.</p>
<h6>2. A free website builder will not give you the best features for your website</h6>
<p>This is certainly not true! All free website builders have built in features that help you choose beautiful designs, apps, settings and menus that will enable your website to be as interactive as possible. Just keep working on it to discover what the capabilities are, and try them out. 24X7 advice should not be far away either.</p>
<h6>3. A free website builder will have glitches</h6>
<p>This could not be further from the truth. Website builders that host multiple websites make sure that they give their users the best quality. How would they attract people to use their product if it has glitches? The fact that it&#8217;s free does not mean its poor quality. The cliché that free is cheap is not true of website builders. So go ahead and use any of the free website builders available online.</p>
<h6>4. Free Website Builders don’t allow you to make changes to your content</h6>
<p>All website builders enable you to create your content and change it whenever and wherever you like. The fact that they host your website does not give you less of a right to control the content you have on your site.</p>
<h6>5. Using a free website builder will make search engines rank your website low</h6>
<p>Nay! Great many websites that are ranking high on search engines are created and hosted on free website builders. It&#8217;s the content that you put on your website that matters, not the website builder hosting it. So don’t be afraid of using a website builder, just make sure your content is relevant and attractive enough for people and search engines.</p>

<p>There, you have it all. Armed with this information plunge into the world wide web and create your own website. To gain more confidence, work on an offline page on your computer and when done, settings are available that will allow you to publish the document you have created onto an online website builder which will facilitate ease of formatting the webpage and work from there!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The web is slowly but securely aligning towards organic philosophy, partly due to the need for consumer engagement and because of the whiplash from search engine algorithm updates. The phenomenon has certainly resulted in a more enriching web experience, coupled with a more engaging Information architecture. An average <strong><a href="http://www.anblik.com/web-designing-company" title="web design company" class="pretty-link-keyword" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">web designing company</a></strong> is finding it easier to compete with well equipped counterparts thanks to the great leveler called simplicity in design. What has been really refreshing to watch is how the new trends are all shaping up a more media rich internet. Multi discipline paradigms are coming into play to make web designing all the more engaging and a potent tool for audience communication.<span id="more-757"></span></p>
<h3>User Engagement: The Keyword to Effective Web Design</h3>
<p>A major paradigm shift has been observed in the way web is perceived in recent times. Owing to the web going more organic, the other facets of the web are also streamlined to meet the core aesthetics. The new wave of web design is ruled by the principles of a cleaner web where information and content is of pivotal importance. Thanks to the rule makers of web world giving stress to reliability of content, the internet is finally looking cleaner and on course to reclaim some lost reliability. Certainly web designing is playing a major part in the whole spectrum of events.</p>

<p>There have been plenty of new techniques that any <strong><a href="http://www.anblik.com/web-designing-company" title="web design company" class="pretty-link-keyword" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">web design company</a></strong> can follow to keep their services viable in the context of evolving web trends. Being a dynamic art, there is never a set parameter of web design, but then again the industry experts vouch for the tested formula than going for a trial and error methodology.</p>
<h3>What to expect in 2014?</h3>
<p>The year 2013 was something of a revelation for web design with many fresh ideas conceptualized and implemented. The trends in year 2014 continue the transition with refined perspective and better set of tools to implement. So what kind of techniques one can expect to be integrated in mainstream production pipeline? Let’s dig deeper.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Responsive bandwagon</strong>: Yes, responsive designs have been the keyword of web deigning in the current scenario. With an increasing population of mobile internet users, the change was just round the corner at the break of 2011. 2013 saw major advancement in the concept and 2014 has been a year of mainstream dominance. Pixel independence is the new mantra that every web designer is looking for nowadays. Having a single code design optimized for multiple platforms is certainly the way to go. Lest we forget, the concept has already proven its worth for being SEO-friendly.</li>
<li><strong>The support for retina displays:</strong> Apple initiated a sort of a movement with their engineering of retina display. Being twice denser in pixel count than normal LCD, the digital supremacy is well established. The professional designers of a <strong><a href="http://www.anblik.com/web-designing-company" title="web design company" class="pretty-link-keyword" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">web design company</a></strong> of repute, nowadays, are churning out pixel perfect designs to complement the superior previewing of retina display. With a number of platforms incorporating the new display type, the trend is not without justification.</li>
<li><strong>The rise of the QR codes: </strong>The abundance of Smartphone usage precipitated for this new trend in design. QR code apps are a rage and almost every little bit of data is just a scan away. Many websites are integrating digital QR codes right in the designs. The trend is yet to catch up but with digital data transmission speeding up, the potential is seemingly abundant.</li>
<li><strong>Landing pages go slimmer: </strong>This is a perfect example of digital optimization of communication. Keeping the emphasis strictly on the core products and services seems to be the perfect way to go for optimum consumer engagement. Serious consumers are keener on strict business and the minimalist landing pages suites their taste, just aptly.</li>
<li><strong>Social media integration: </strong>No study on the prevailing web trends can be complete without the mention of the big boy. Yes, Social media is changing the way we communicate, opening up newer and subtler modes of brand communication. To aid viral marketing and the optimum use of social media, the social media badges are becoming increasingly mainstream.</li>
</ul>
<p> <script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-3041661396831610";
/* 468x60 Anblik Adv */
google_ad_slot = "8901003564";
google_ad_width = 468;
google_ad_height = 60;
//-->
</script><br />
<script type="text/javascript"

</script></p>
<p>Well, these are only a few of the trends that are catching the imagination of the web designers. The connoisseurs of the web world certainly don’t vouch for a trend to go mainstream for a long run. The existing trends are also viable till the web design landscape again goes for a revamping.

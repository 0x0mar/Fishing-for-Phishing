30 Scientists have determined that the average time for intercourse is four  minutes. The average number of strokes per minute is nine, and since the average  length of the penis is six inches, the average female received two hundred and  sixteen inches or fifteen feet per intercourse. Three times per week, fifty two  weeks in a year, so, 150 times 18 makes 2700 feet, or just over a mile and a  half. If you are not getting your mile and a half, why not let me help out?<br />

737 Where's your paper bag? (What?) Your paper bag to put over your head.  (Excuse me?) It's dangerous for someone like you to be out in public with all of  these horny people around. Don't worry, I'll protect you.<br />
738 When I saw you from across the room, I passed out cold and hit my head on  the floor...so I'm going to need your name and number for insurance reasons.<br />
739 Has anyone ever told you that you have Scandinavian hands? (Uh, no.) No, of  course not, that would be an incredibly stupid thing to say, wouldn't it?<br />

753 There aren't enough "O"'s in the word "smooth" to describe how smooth you  are.<br />
754 This is incredible. This is the first time that this has ever happened to  us. (What?) Each one of my 27 personalities found you cute!<br />
755 If beauty were an hour, you'd be a second.<br />
756 Wow, you have some sweet birthin' hips.<br />
757 (Walk up to them and touch them) Thank God, I thought that you were only an  illusion(mirage).<br />
758 If beauty were a grain of sand, you'd be a million beaches.<br />

771 You are a 9.9999. You'd be a perfect 10 if you were with me.<br />
772 Excuse me, I'd like to have kids someday, and I wanted to know how your  parents created such a beautiful creature.<br />
773 When God made you, he was showing off.<br />
774 (Bump into someone) If I knew how hot you were I would have grabbed your ass  instead of bumping into you.<br />
775 Roses are red, violets are black, why is your chest as flat as my back?<br />
776 Hey, don't frown - you'll never know who might be falling in love with your  smile.<br />

786 Listen to this: my buddies over there said that I wouldn't be able to start  a conversation with the most beautiful boy/girl in the bar. Wanna buy some  drinks with some of their money?<br />
787 You must be a high jumper, because you make my bar raise!<br />
788 If I received a nickel for everytime I saw someone as beautiful as you, I'd  have five cents.<br />
789 Have you seen my enormous jar of "Penis Reducing Cream"?<br />

791 If you were even half as gorgeous as me, I'd consider sleeping with you.<br />
792 You wet? I'd bet you are after looking at me.<br />
793 You're so fine, I'd suck your daddy's dick just to get some of where that  came from.<br />

887 You know, when you and I get old and your son/daughter comes up to me and  says "Daddy, how did you meet mommy?" I'm gonna have to tell him/her how quiet  you were, or how difficult you were being."<br />
888 OK, it's not very big and I'm not very good, but I've got the cutest little  way of getting on and off.<br />
889 Drive around like a car and make screeching sounds and say "Uh, sorry, my  uh, breaks aren't working well. Where are you headed?"<br />
890 Excuse me. Do you have chicken in your fridge? (yes) How big are your  breasts?<br />
891 It's not my fault I fell in love. You are the one that tripped me.<br />
892 Um, you have really beautiful.....uh....eyes, yea. You are pretty. What I  mean is... You have a nice forehead. (Messing Up) Do you believe in when I walk  by..... (To yourself) Oh Man, shit, STUPID STUPID STUPID!<br />
893 Be unique and different, say yes.<br />
894 Can I buy you a drink or do you just want the money?<br />
895 Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?<br />
896 Hi, my name is {name}, how do you like me so far?<br />
897 Hi. Are you cute?<br />
898 I can sense that you're a terrific lover, and it intimidates me a little.<br />
899 I'm easy. Are you?<br />
900 I'm fighting the urge to make you the happiest woman on earth tonight.<br />
901 I'm trying to determine after years of therapy and lots of testing, whether  or not I'm allergic to sex.<br />
902 Inheriting eighty million bucks doesn't mean much when you have a weak  heart.<br />
903 So....How am I doin'?<br />
904 You see my friend over there? [Point to friend who sheepishly waves from  afar] He wants to know if YOU think I'M cute.<br />
905 Do you have a boyfriend? No. Want one?(if yes: Want another one?)<br />
906 Do you have a boyfriend? (Yes) Do you mess around? (No) Would you hold still  while I do?<br />
907 When she's leaving:"Hey, where are you going?" Answer:"home." You:"You're  not just gonna leave me here like this are you?"<br />
908 Okay, so I came over here to ask you to dance, but I'm kind of concerned. I  mean, we could hit it off really well, end up having a few drinks, next thing  you know you're giving me your number because I'm too shy to ask for it, I  finally get up the nerve to call and we take in a movie, have some dinner, I  relax, you relax, we go out a few more times, get to know each other's friends,  spend a lot of time together, then finally have get past this sexual tension and  really develop this intense sex life that is truly incredible, decide our  relationship is solid and stable, so we move in together for a while, then a few  months later get married, I get a promotion, you get a promotion, we buy a  bigger house. You really want kids, but I really want freedom, but we have a kid  anyway, only to find that I am resentful, the sparks start to fade and to  rekindle them we have two more lovely kids, but now I work too much to keep up  with the bills, have no time for you, you're stressed and stop taking really  good care of yourself, so to get past our slow sex life and my declining  self-confidence I turn to an outside affair for sexual gratification. You find  out because I'm careless and a lousy liar, you throw me out (justifiably so) and  we have to explain to the kids why mommy and daddy are splitting up. That's just  too sad. Think about the children. For God's sake, if you dance with me and we  hit it off, let's just keep it sexual, because we both know where it's going.<br />
909 Gee, that's a nice set of legs, what time do they open?<br />
910 Does your boyfriend know where you are?<br />
911 The only thing your eyes haven't told me is your name.<br />
912 If I were to ask you for sex, would your answer be the same as the answer to  this question?<br />
913 (Approach a group of them) I'm gonna have sex with you, you, and you.  Alright, who's first?<br />
914 (give the person a bottle of tequila) Drink this, then call me when you're  ready.<br />
915 Excuse me, I just noticed you noticing me and I just wanted to give you  notice that I noticed you too.<br />
916 Hi, will you help me find my lost puppy? I think he went into this cheap  motel room across the street.<br />
917 As you walk by, turn around and say: Excuse me, did you just touch my ass?  No. Damn!<br />
918 I bet you \$20 you're gonna turn me down.<br />
919 All this could be yours for one low, low price!<br />
920 Believe it or not, gettin' laid is still hard when you're this good-looking.<br />
921 I'm friendly and slow moving!<br />
922 (Walk over to her)"Ok, you can stand next to me, as long as you don't talk  about it."<br />
923 Chicks dig me. I wear colored underwear.<br />
924 Come on, you can't get pregnant again.<br />
925 Did you know that the word 'motel' spelled backwards means 'letom'?<br />
926 Do I know you from somewhere, because I don't recognize you with your  clothes on?<br />
927 Do you think I could borrow that dress/bustier sometime?<br />
928 Excuse me, miss? Hi, I'm doing a scavenger hunt for my fraternity rush, and  one of the things on my list is a umm....weird chick.<br />
929 Free mammograms, get your free mammograms here, get 'em while they're hot!<br />
930 Have you run into any trees lately? Then how bout a root!<br />
931 Hello, Susie. Your mom couldn't make it this afternoon, she asked me to pick  you up and take you home. My, what a pretty dress.<br />
932 HI! Can I buy you a car?<br />
933 Hi, I make more money than you can spend.<br />
934 I found this [lace glove, rosary, etc.] on the floor at the club last night,  is it yours? Well, if it's not, I'd like to give it to you anyway.<br />
935 I saw you at the party last weekend and you look kind of interesting.. Let's  meet sometime...<br />
936 Is it that cold out or are you just smuggling tic-tac's<br />
937 Want to see my stamp collection?<br />
938 What's a nice girl like you doing with a face like that?<br />
939 You know, if we cut your arms off, you'd look just like Venus de Milo.<br />
940 You have the ass of a great artist.<br />
941 If I pet you, would you follow me home?<br />
942 Greetings and salivations<br />
943 Chicks dig me because I rarely wear any underwear, and when I do it is  usually something eroticaly exotic...want to see?<br />
944 I need to dump my load. Do you mind waiting for me on the bonnet of my car?<br />
945 Pardon me, can I borrow your spatula?<br />
946 I have big feet.<br />
947 Not only can I palm an NBA basketball, I wear a 13 1/2 size shoe<br />
948 I want you to have my children. In fact, you can have them right now,  they're out in the car.<br />
